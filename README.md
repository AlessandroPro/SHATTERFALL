#SHATTERFALL


SHATTERFALL is a battle arena style PC game that is playable with 2-4 players using Xbox 360 controllers.
Each player is placed at corner of a large hexagonal platform at the start of the game. They each shoot shockwaves through the platform to shatter the floor beneath their opponents to make them fall. The goal is to be the last player standing!  
Each game is very quick, lasting from a few seconds to possibly a minute or two.


The game is a collaboration between two students from Ryerson University, Alessandro Profenna and Dennis Plotnik. 
The concept for the game was realized in October 2015, with the full development period beginning in early January 2016. SHATTERFALL was developed using the UNITY 3D game engine and was written in C#. All 3D assets were created and animated in Blender.


The game was completed at the beginning of April, just in time for Level Up Showcase 2016. This event was held on April 6, 2016 at the Design Exchange in Downtown Toronto, Canada. The annual event allows students across Ontario to showcase games they've made to the public.
